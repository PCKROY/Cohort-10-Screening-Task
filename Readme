Cohort Task 1.1 file contains 'Naive Simulation using Matrix Multiplication' task. 
In this file, I have defined a quantum circuit that consists of X, H, CNOT and Identity gates.
What I did was I supposed if we have 3 qubits and CNOT is applied on the first 2, then an Identity gate is applied on the 
last qubit. Then I did a tensor between the CNOT and Identity matrix gates which gave me a matrix that can be applied to the state.
First I initialized the state with 'initialize_state' functuion. Then I applied the gates sequentially with 'apply_single_qubit_gate'
and 'apply_cnot' functions and simulated the ciruit. Then with 'measure_runtime' function, I ploted the runtime of the number of qubits.
In this way, I only ploted 14 qubits in this file.

Cohort task 1.2 file contains 'Advanced simulation using tensor multiplication' task.
In this file, I have did almost the same thing that I did for the Cohort task 1.1
But in here, I built quantum tensor state and then I applied the gates X, H, CNOT sequentially to the quantum tensor state 
by doing tensor multiplication (np.tensordot). Then I ploted the runtime of the number of qubits by measure_runtime().
In this way, I can simulate only upto 4 qubits.
